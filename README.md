##Exploratory Data Analysis of Bank Historical Stock Data

Welcome to our exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing historical stock data of banks. In this project, we delve into publicly available financial datasets, specifically bank stock prices, aiming to gain valuable insights into the banking industry's behavior. Our analysis spans the period from the financial crisis to early 2020, providing a comprehensive view of how bank stocks have progressed over time.

## Project Overview

In this repository, we perform in-depth exploratory data analysis on historical stock data obtained from public sources. We utilize the powerful Python library, **pandas**, to directly fetch data from Yahoo Finance. The primary objective is to illustrate a step-by-step approach to analyze and visualize various features within the dataset. Our analysis sheds light on key trends, patterns, and behaviors within the banking sector, offering a better understanding of the industry's dynamics.

## Key Features of the Repository

- **Data Preprocessing:** The repository contains detailed scripts and notebooks demonstrating how to preprocess the publicly available financial dataset. This preprocessing step is crucial for ensuring data accuracy and consistency in subsequent analyses.

- **Data Visualization:** We generate a variety of graphs and visualizations using libraries such as **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. These visualizations provide intuitive representations of stock price movements, trends, and volatility, enabling comprehensive analysis.

- **Dashboard Creation:** Our project includes the creation of an interactive dashboard using **Tableau**. This dashboard synthesizes the processed data and visualizations, offering a user-friendly interface for exploring the insights derived from the dataset.

## Repository Contents

- **Data Preprocessing Scripts:** Contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering techniques tailored for financial datasets.

- **Visualization Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks showcasing different types of visualizations, including line charts, candlestick charts, and heatmaps, providing a holistic view of bank stock data.

- **Tableau Dashboard Files:** Includes Tableau workbook files (.twb) and associated data extracts, enabling users to interact with the data through an intuitive dashboard interface.
