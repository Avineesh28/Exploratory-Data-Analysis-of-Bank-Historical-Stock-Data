# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Bank-Historical-Stock-Data
In this Visualisation Project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of banks stock prices. We will use pandas to directly read data from Yahoo Finance. The main objective is to show step-by-step how to analyze and visualize different features from the dataset to have a better understanding of the bank industry and how it behaves.

We will focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2020.
