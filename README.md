# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Bank-Historical-Stock-Data
In this Visualisation Project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of banks stock prices. We will use pandas to directly read data from Yahoo Finance. The main objective is to show step-by-step how to analyze and visualize different features from the dataset to have a better understanding of the bank industry and how it behaves.

We will focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2020.

The following questions will be answered throughout the Project:

# What is the max Close price for each bank's stock throughout the time period?
# On what date did Citigroup stock reach its highest price?
# Why does the first row have NaN values?
# Is there a stock that stands out?
# Did anything significant happen on 2009-01-20?
# Which stock would you classify as the riskiest over the entire time period?
# Which would you classify as the riskiest for the year 2015?
# What is the rolling 30 day average against the Close Price for Bank Of America's stock for the year 2008?
